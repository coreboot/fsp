## Raptor Lake Binary
For descriptions of the 12th, 13th, & 14th Generation Intel® Core™ processors and chipsets (formerly Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, & Raptor Lake Refresh) SKU(s). Please consult the table below:

Directory Name | SKU Description
:------------- | :-------------------------
Client/RaptorLakeP | U-Series, P-Series, & H-Series processors for client platforms
Client/RaptorLakeS | HX-Series & desktop processors for client platforms
IoT/RaptorLakeS | Desktop processors for IoT platforms

## Differentiating Client and IoT

Client and IoT (Internet of Things) SKUs of 12th, 13th, & 14th Generation Intel® Core™ processors and chipsets (formerly Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, & Raptor Lake Refresh) processors can be differentiated by checking the processor number. Processor numbers ending in a "E" are IoT SKUs, processor numbers that do not end in "E" are client SKUs. For example, the Intel® Core™ i9-13900 is a client SKU and the Intel® Core™ i9-13900E is an IoT SKU.
